Stata code and data for replicating analyses presented in: Douglas B. Atkinson Atkinson, Naji Bsisu, Joshua L. Jackson, and George W. Williford. 2020. "Go with the Flow: How Rivalry and Refugee Movements Impact Repression." Working paper.

## Project Description
When does an influx of refugees lead the host state to engage in repression? Does the presence of an international rivalry influence this? In this study, we unify literature on interstate rivalries, refugee flows, and preemptive repression to examine when and how massive influxes of refugees lead host governments to engage in increased levels of repression against the incoming refugees and the domestic population as a whole. We focus on refugee flows as a possible source of threat perception and argue that host states do not perceive threats equally from all incoming populations. We argue that the threat posed by refugee influxes is mitigated when those refugees are fleeing a state whose host is a rival. Put simply, where the refugees come from matters. We test our assertions on a global sample of dyadic pairs of states from 1961 to 2006 and find support for our argument.
